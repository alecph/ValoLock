## How to use

### Installing

*Final version of ValoLock will come in a .exe file, but early version will be a .py file*

1. Download **checker.py** and run it

*This lets you know what libraries you need to install to run ValoLock*

2. Install any missing libraries

How you do this is up to you, but I reccomend using `pip install [libraryname]` in your terminal/console

3. Follow the other instructions bellow to instalock Valorant agents

### Instalocking

1. Launch Valorant
2. Run main.py
3. Select your region using the UP, DOWN, and ENTER keys
4. Set your agent pool (**Menu Option 1**)
5. Repeat step 4 for every map
6. Start instalock (**Menu Option 2**)

After every game you will need to repeat step 6 if you want to instalock the next game

## How it works

ValoLock works by sending an API request on behalf of your computer. It does not mess with any files or game configs.
