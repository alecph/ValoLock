# ValoLock

The most user friendly way to instalock in Valorant

**NOTE: `This is against Riot's API usage, and could potentialy get you banned. Use with caution! I am not responsible for any bans.`**

## Features
- Easy to use interface
- Random agent pools (If you add more agents)
- Instalock delay, if you want to seem more legit
- Frequent updates
- Many more!

## How to use

1. Launch Valorant
2. Run main.py
3. Select your region using the UP, DOWN, and ENTER keys
4. Set your agent pool (**Menu Option 1**)
5. Repeat step 4 for every map
6. Start instalock (**Menu Option 2**)

After every game you will need to repeat step 6 if you want to instalock the next game

## How it works

ValoLock works by sending an API request on behalf of your computer. It does not mess with any files or game configs.
